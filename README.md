# PUSH SWAP

##  Structures
	
#### Stack
	I'm gonna use linked list structure to get stack.
	As we've to use input output operations on both ends of the stack, we've to use double ended linked list.
	At the same time, when we do the sorting, we've to use the different indicator other than the actual value
	to group the vales into small chunks so I've to use additional variable for that.
